This project has errors on purpose:
- If you open it on intellij you can switch of the highlight by following instructions here https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/disabling-and-enabling-inspections.html#change-highlighting-level-for-file this will switch all high besides the `char` ones
- If you open this on vscode you can add this to you settings.json file
```
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "editorError.foreground": "#00000000",
        "editorWarning.foreground": "#00000000",
        "editorInfo.foreground": "#00000000",
    }
```

This is done so the recruit does not relay on the IDE to indicate the issues with the line
